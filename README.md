File input format:
```
a = ___
b = ___
c = ___
```
> [!WARNING]
> Incorrect file input will shut down the program.
## How does it work?

You can solve another equation after previous.
It will ask, would you like to repeat. If you want to continue, you should type "1". Any other answer will be regarded as "No".
> [!NOTE]
> You can use file input only with first run of the program. If you need to solve another equation, you should enter data using STDIN.
